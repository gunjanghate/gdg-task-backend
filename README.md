## About

The **GDG Task Management** backend offers a comprehensive REST API for managing tasks and users. The backend handles user authentication, task creation, updates, and deletions, and supports secure data storage using MongoDB.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Users can register, log in, and log out using secure JWT-based authentication.
- **Task Management:** Users can create, update, delete, and view tasks.
- **User Management:** Manage user profiles and user-specific task lists.
- **RESTful API:** Follows REST principles with clear and consistent endpoints.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:**
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  - MongoDB (Database)
  - Mongoose (ODM)
  
- **Frontend:**
  - Next.js

## Installation

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gunjanghate/gdg-task-backend.git
   ```

### 2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd gdg-task-backend
   ```

### 3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### 4. Set up environment variables:

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following environment variables:

   ```bash
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=your_mongo_db_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

### 5. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The server will run on `http://localhost:5000`.

## API Documentation

Here are some of the core API endpoints. All requests should include the `Content-Type: application/json` header.
